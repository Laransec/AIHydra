# Background: 

Current Version: 2.5.1
API endpoints are at /api.

Scanned /api with the default dirbuster directory-list-2.3-small.txt and found endpoints

I investigated /api/command and guessed the JSON format of {"command" : "commandhere"} which allows for command execution as root.

Cat /etc/ shadow returns

Cracking root password hash with John The Ripper and the rockyou.txt wordlist returned
 3l3v3n           (root)

The Dropbear SSH client was available. I started it though the command API

Setting a password on the web interface does enforce a login cookie requirement before accessing the API endpoint. As with many IOT devices this doesnâ€™t matter because they rolled their own weird webserver into the binary that runs everything. 
An unauthenticated POST request to /setpassword works to set a new password. Responds with a valid cookie. You can use this cookie to go back and run commands as root.
